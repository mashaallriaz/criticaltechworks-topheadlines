Hi, thank you for reviewing my code. 
Here are some assumptions I made while writing this code, please read this before reviewing.
- I understand that the headlines list is a paged list but since the requirement wasn't specified as such, I didn't treat it as one and instead just displayed the first page in the app. 
- For the second flavour, it wasn't specified which news source to use so I chose 'Independent News'. 
- I did implement biometric verification but I did not block the UI until verification was done because it wasn't specified in the requirements as such.
